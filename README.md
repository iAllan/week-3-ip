# Delani Studio Site

#### Template for Design Webpage, April 2020

#### By **Allan Bosire**

## Description

This project is a landing page for a Webdesign Company. IT had a minimal design with each section neatly divided for an easy viewing experience.

## Setup

- Fork and Clone Repository
- Open in Editor of Choice
- Code Away

## Known Bugs

The "What We Do" section has hidden text that was initially supposed to show when clicked. My inexperience with JavaScript means I was unable to implement this properly. Idealy there should be an onclick event that toggles between the text and the image.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
